## Tools

Coding isn't just about writing code, it's also about using tools *around* code.

### A code editor

We're using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for this, mostly because that's what I happen to use. There are other code editors like [Atom]() and [Notepad++](), which are good, too.

Fundamentally they all do the same thing: edit text files. You could absolutely make websites with the text editor that comes with your operating system â€” code editors just make things more convenient by adding things like syntax highlighting, shortcuts, and advanced search.

### A browser

Most web devlopers use Chrome, I like Firefox. Both these browsers have built-in developer tools we'll be using.

### The command line
It's called *Terminal* on a Mac. It lets you type commands to do stuff on your machine. We won't be using it much for this, but it' good to get comfortable with it as a lot of advanced tooling (ie git) happens on the command line.

### Node.js

Node is a programming language. We just need it to run some tooling. We'll use (I guess) Browsersync

## How to look things up

There are dozens of HTML elements and attributes, and hundreds of CSS properties. Few people memorise all of them, and that's okay: Professional programmers look things up all the time.
