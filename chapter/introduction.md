## The web is everywhere

Websites run on everything: Phones, computers, game consoles, cars, fridges. The web is the most efficient (and, in large parts of the world, the only) way to transmit information. [1](#note-1)

## The web is for everyone

If someone has a hard time reading your copy, they can change your type sizes, colours and layout to suit their needs. Some people may choose to translate your copy into a different language, or have it read aloud. They can easily remove distractions (such as ads). You can ask people for information (such as their location), but it's up to them to give it to you. They can make local copies of images and texts on your website.

These are all good things. Embrace them.

## The web is open

The web is built on open-source technologies. What technologies are implemented on the web platform is decided by the W3C, a group of representatives from industry, government and non-profits. Their proceedings are public.

The best code editors, documentation, browsers, and workflow tools for making websites are free.

You can view the source code of any website you visit (including this one). Right-click and *Inspect Element*.

## Making websites isn't that hard

The programming languages we will discuss soon are explicitely *designed* to be used by anyone, not just software engineers. HTML and CSS are design tools.

The idea that programming is for "geniuses" (usually men) with computer science degrees is a cultural artifact. You can do a lot with a few simple lines of code.
